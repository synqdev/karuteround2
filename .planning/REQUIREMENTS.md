## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Appointment scheduling/booking | Full product domain, not related to karute creation |
| POS / payment processing | Separate concern, adds massive complexity |
| Marketing / campaigns | Not a karute feature |
| Loyalty programs | Not a karute feature |
| Real-time streaming transcription | Batch after recording is simpler and sufficient for v1 |
| Mobile native app | Web-first, responsive design covers tablet use |
| Multi-tenant / multi-business | Single business for v1, architect for expansion later |
| OAuth / social login | Single shared business login sufficient |
| Data migration from other systems | v2+ feature |
| Offline mode | Requires service worker complexity, defer to v2 |
| Dashboard analytics | v2 feature |
