# Roadmap: Karute

## Overview

Build a digital karute (client record-keeping) app for Japanese service businesses — salons, spas, clinics. The journey starts with project foundation, database, and working audio recording in Phase 1, then layers AI transcription and extraction, customer management, karute record saving, staff profiles, UI polish, export, and integration testing. Each phase delivers a complete, verifiable capability that compounds into the full product.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 8: Integration Testing** - End-to-end integration tests for main flows and test data cleanup

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation + Recording
**Goal**: The project runs locally and in CI, data persists to Supabase, and a staff member can open the app and record a session through the browser microphone.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: FOUND-01, FOUND-02, FOUND-03, FOUND-04, FOUND-05, FOUND-06, FOUND-07, REC-01, REC-02, REC-03, REC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Developer can run `npm dev` and see the app at localhost with dark theme shell and sidebar
  2. Supabase schema exists with customers, karute_records, entries, and profiles tables with RLS policies applied
  3. User can log in with business email/password and be redirected to the app
  4. User can open the recording modal, select a staff member, press record, see a live waveform and timer, and stop to produce an audio blob
  5. CI runs on pull requests, integration branch workflow is configured, and PRs use @claude tag convention
**Plans**: 7 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01-PLAN.md — Next.js 16 scaffold with Tailwind v4 CSS-first config, shadcn, dark theme shell, collapsible sidebar
- [ ] 01-02-PLAN.md — Supabase schema (4 tables + RLS policies), browser/server clients, TypeScript types, dev/prod env config
- [ ] 01-03-PLAN.md — Supabase Auth email/password login, protected route group, proxy.ts token refresh
- [ ] 01-04-PLAN.md — next-intl v4 i18n routing (EN/JP), locale layout with NextIntlClientProvider, proxy.ts composition
- [ ] 01-05-PLAN.md — GitHub Actions CI (lint + type-check + test), integration branch workflow CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] 01-06-PLAN.md — MediaRecorder hooks with format negotiation, waveform visualization, recording timer
- [ ] 01-07-PLAN.md — Recording modal UI with staff selector, state machine (idle → recording → recorded)

### Phase 2: AI Pipeline
**Goal**: A recorded audio blob flows through Whisper transcription and GPT extraction, producing a transcript, categorized entries with confidence scores, and a session summary — all in the user's chosen language — before the audio is discarded.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: AI-01, AI-02, AI-03, AI-04, AI-05, AI-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After stopping a recording, the audio is sent to Whisper and a Japanese/English transcript appears in the UI
  2. GPT produces structured entries (Preference, Treatment, Lifestyle, etc.) each with a category, title, source quote, and confidence score
  3. A prose session summary is generated and visible alongside the entries
  4. AI outputs (entry titles, summary text) respect the active language toggle (EN or JP)
  5. No audio file is ever written to Supabase Storage — only transcript text and extracted entries are persisted
  6. User sees a human review screen where they can edit, add, or remove AI-extracted entries before saving
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01-PLAN.md — Shared AI types/Zod schemas, OpenAI client singleton, locale-aware prompts, Whisper transcription API route

### Phase 8: Integration Testing
**Goal**: The core end-to-end flow (record → transcribe → extract → review → save → view) is covered by automated integration tests that clean up after themselves, giving confidence in future changes.
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: TEST-01, TEST-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Automated integration tests cover the full record → transcribe → extract → save → view karute flow and pass in CI
  2. Test runs do not leave any data in the Supabase test database — teardown cleans up all created customers, karute records, and entries
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: Integration test setup — test environment config, Supabase test project connection, test auth helpers, mock for OpenAI API calls
- [ ] 08-02: Core flow integration tests — record (mock audio) → transcribe → extract → review → save → view karute record
- [ ] 08-03: Test teardown and cleanup — afterEach/afterAll hooks that delete all test-created records from Supabase
